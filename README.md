Hey I am Mrunal Vairagade from CSE Dept.
This is the submission of the assignment of Devcom.

Part 1:
Just unzip the Part 1 file as it is and run the main.py file.
I have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, javascript, python smtplib, flask, and Jinja.
I have included three main pages including home hobby and contact. On display, home will appear. Hobby has
three subpages showing info about each of the hobbies.
I have just started to learn javascript and because of that I have not used it much.
Please make sure to have an active internet connection while using the contact form.

To use the contact form make an app password for your email id and change your smtp address as well(if
necessary). Instructions for making app password is in the code comments.
